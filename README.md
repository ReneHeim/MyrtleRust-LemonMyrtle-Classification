# Studies on MyrtleRust-LemonMyrtle-Classification in Northern NSW

This repository contains code needed to reproduce the article:

**Heim R, ....S** Title. In review.

## Instructions

All analyses were done in `R`. To recreate the results, install the appropriate packages and run the commands in the file `analysis.R`. To achieve this [download this repository](https://github.com/reneheim/myrtlerust-lemonmyrtle-classification/archive/master.zip), and then open an R session with working directory set to the root of the project.

Note: This is the first analysis I have made fully reproducible and contains what I would consider now some antiquated coding. But it works!
